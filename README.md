**developersNote-070122:** <br />
Project will temporarily be on hold. Continuation will be on the month of August 2022. Need to get back to my learning phase since the development phase on the month of June burnt me out and I kinda wanna move forward and learn some Back-End Frameworks, Nodejs, and the use of public APIs to have more cooler projects.
In the meantime, I will slowly work on **Media Queries** to have more of a responsive design for the website as well as it being more mobile friendly.
