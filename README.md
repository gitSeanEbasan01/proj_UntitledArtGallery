Website for my artworks using HTML, CSS, Javascript.

**projectUpdate082622:** <br />
- [Goal] Review and analyze CSS and JavaScript in gallerySwipe for the implementation of Media Query as well as a reunderstanding of your own code.

**projectUpdate082222:** <br />
- [Done] Media query in navBar is finished along with the hamburger button.
- [Done] Work on media query for the titleSection.

**projectUpdate081222:** <br />
- [Done] Able to add media query for navCategoryContainer. Separating in both active and non-active element.
- [Done] Able to add a transparent exit for the explore button so there's no need to look for a negative space.
- [Done] Need to add media query for non-active navCategoryContainer. And based on media query, replace navButtons with a single "x" button. (800px)
- [Done] navcExplore underline glitch when using the button itself to exit.
- [Goal] Continue with the About button next session.

**projectUpdate080822:** <br />
- Successfully and currently working on the browser width for navInfo media query. Still needs more work but progress for today was decent.

**projectIssues080522:** <br />
- [Done] I need to apply the current browser width to the media query so that the width of navInfo will somehow set itself, to what I can say, in realtime. Possible solution: Look up somewhere in the css section where I used the browser width for some sort of mechanic a few months ago and use that as a reference.

**projectIssues080222:** <br />
- In the smallest query, there's no way of exiting the nav menu since it took all the negative space for exiting. Possible solution is to use the nav category button itself to exit.
- Project title is on top of the nav menu.
- Nav category button should extend when active.
- No idea what it looks like on the phone.
- Should probably use hamburger icon for mobile users.

**projectObservations080322:** <br />
- I should've worked on media query in the early stages of this project. Especially when it comes to mobile and touch screen mechanics.
- This project is a mess. I went way too ambitious with my ability to code without mastering the fundamentals.
- Solution: Slowly work on organizing and retouching this project. Small progress with consistency and efficiency is key.

Project will temporarily be on hold. Continuation will be on the month of August 2022. Need to get back to my learning phase since the development phase on the month of June burnt me out and I kinda wanna move forward and learn some Back-End Frameworks, Nodejs, and the use of public APIs to have more cooler projects.
In the meantime, I will slowly work on **Media Queries** to have more of a responsive design for the website as well as it being more mobile friendly.

**developersNote-080122:** <br />
The continuation of the project will start today. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to learn anything during the month of July due to life, camping, and procrastination. Currently, I'm reviewing the code that I worked on in the previous months and am glad that it doesn't look like ancient hieroglyphics, especially after a month of not seeing it. While continuing, I will learn NodeJS if I wanna progress in this Software Development journey. I'll also be tackling Media Query, image optimization, and an extra page for the website. That is the plan, however, we'll see if I'll stick through it.
